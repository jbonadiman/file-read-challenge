# 🧩 File read challenge 🧩
_The challenge involves reading through very large files of data from the Federal Elections Commission and displaying back specific data from those files._

🧠 **Specifications:**
*  Write a program that will print out the total number of lines in the file.
* Notice that the 8th column contains a person’s name. Write a program that loads in this data and creates an array with all name strings. Print out the 432nd and 43243rd names.
* Notice that the 5th column contains a form of date. Count how many donations occurred in each month and print out the results.
* Notice that the 8th column contains a person’s name. Create an array with each first name. Identify the most common first name in the data and how many times it occurs.
